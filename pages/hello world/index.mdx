Hi there. My name is Paul. I am a fairly new web developer with a primary focus on front end. My background before becoming a full-time software dev was 7.5 years in the semiconductor industry as a test engineer. I've been helped quite a bit by posts on the web as I have continued to improve my javascript accumen. So I want to give back and give everyone some perspective as I learn new and cool things. Check back as I make occasional posts on things I learn. Take care!
